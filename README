It's a project for my graduation work.

For the beginning, there're a bot (further more) and a camera.
Also there's a destination. Now it's something red.

boe-bot.bs2 - upload to the Boe-Bot's memory
firstone.py - implements computer vision and calls main_f.cxx for work
main_f.cxx  - connects to bot through XBee, sends and receives signals
